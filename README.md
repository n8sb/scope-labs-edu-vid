**An overview:**  
My educational video app uses an instance of NextJs with a simple and clean interface. It is limited to youtube videos since you can grab a screenshot from the video url to populate placeholder images for the playable videos. It is also responsive / mobile friendly. All API queries use the built in fetch API.

I also used a handful of packages to enhance the app's functionality:  
react-player - video player  
react-spinners - loading indicator  
react-toastify - alerts / notifications  
faker-js - populate random commenter names / ids

**How to run:**  
Run the application by running the following commands:

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
